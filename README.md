# Password Generator Starter Code
DESCRIPTION: write javascript code to generate a random password that meets the acceptance criteria

The password generator web application was created by applying the tools we learned this past week in class
to write a javascript code to generate a random password that meets the acceptance criteria. The current state of the 
application is that it is working 100% as desired without any bugs.
